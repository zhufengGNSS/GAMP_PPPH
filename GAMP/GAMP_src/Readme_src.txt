The installation of GAMP in Windows, UNIX/Linux, and Macintosh can refer to the user's manual.
It is strongly recommended that one debug GAMP under Microsoft Visual Studio (VS), and then compile 
and run it in UNIX/Linux or Macintosh for batch processing, which will make GAMP more efficient to use.
